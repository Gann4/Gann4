<h1>Welcome to my profile!<br>I'm Santiago - Also known as Gann4Life.</h1>
  
Creating anything is enough for me to feel obsessed about it, it doesn't matter if it's just a website, desktop application, videogame, as long as I'm creating something useful that makes life easier, solving tedious problems or just entertainment to get out of real world for a bit.
