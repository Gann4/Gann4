I'm a game developer mainly covering programming side by building flexible and solid systems for both 3D and 2D games.

I also create in-engine tools for Unity to help designers and other members of the team create scenarios and provide game data in a seamless way.

As hobby I enjoy creating visual arts and music as well, I have a wide vision of how everything on the artistic side can be integrated while the prototype or system is being done.

Currently studying both Programming & Game Development  careers
